# Changes I would like to do:

- Header organization

    I think I would like to actually stick to proper header/source organization, but still do unity build.

    Main priority is the entity/world code

- Entity state machine is so weird

- Pathfinding is slow

- Make sense of ground generation

- Bring back the turn priority queue

# Features to do:

- Kenshi style limb system and combat around it
